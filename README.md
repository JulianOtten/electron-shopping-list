# Electron Shopping List

This application was inspired by Traversy Media. All I did is adding localStorage support.

___
Installing is really simple. Just clone the repository to your system and run
```
npm i
```
To simply start the application once, you can run ```npm start ```
___
If you want the application installed for yourself, but dont want a full installer, you can run one of the following commands
```
npm run package-linux
npm run package-win
npm run package-mac
```
depending on your OS.

___
Want to share the application with your friends? Run
```
npm run build-installer
```
and a `dir` folder will appear, with the installer in it.

There are going to be some other files, which you can simply toss away. All you need is the installer and you are good to go!
